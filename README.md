ROLI Lightpad Block code for running as a high-res multi XY surface

This LittleFoot script will turn a ROLI Lightpad Block into a high-res multi XY surface. Multi as in five times... for five fingers... at the same time!
For every finger (page actually) it shows a pulsing (on the beat if available) gem in a bright colour. The position of these  gems are translated into MIDI Control Changes which can be mapped to anything in modern DAW's (Digital Audio Workstations) such as Ableton Live. A configuration mode on the device itself facilitates the easy creation of this kind of mappings.


The arrangement of pages is as follows:

| Page | Colour | CC X | CC Y | CC Z |
| -----|:------:|:------:|:------:| ----:|
| 0    | orange | 3 | 11 | 14 |
